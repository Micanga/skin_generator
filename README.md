# ForeverPixelated: a skin generator for games.

**Abstract:** The image processing and enhancement represent a significant challenge for modern computer science, once it can provide the opportunity to extract data and improve techniques for diverse purposes, e.g., fingerprint recognition, warehouse product cataloguing or the identification and classification of diseases.
Besides these possibilities, image processing methods are in our daily life casual tasks, such as filtering photos on Instagram or modifying images by Photoshop.
These usages are casual but present the image processing wide range and its incorporation in society.
Games companies are producing games that enable the creation of contents inside the game's universe.
Animal Crossing: New Horizons, for example, allows the player to create outfits design (cloths or hats) and wear them.
In this way, this project proposes the creation of a "skin generator" for some games that allows the design of content in-game via pixel-art.
We propose to create the content's design through a local photo update and transform it into the pixelated design for the game, providing it to the user for casual purpose.
Applying image processing techniques, we aim to present the result in an optimised and easy-to-use way.

**Keywords:** Image Processing; Image Segmentation; Image Features Extraction.

## Goal

The main goals of this project can be presented as follow:

1. Perform an image segmentation for separate the photo's cloth, background and objects;
2. Extract the relevant information for transformation into pixel-art content;
3. Transform the real image into the pixel-art module, and;
4. Process it and provide the correct result image to upload at the game.
